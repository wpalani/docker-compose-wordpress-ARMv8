# docker-compose-wordpress for Apple M1,2,3.
This project is a fork of [aschmelyun/docker-compose-wordpress](https://github.com/aschmelyun/docker-compose-wordpress).

I usually use [LocalWP](https://localwp.com/) for WordPress development but I ran into several issues due to environment limitations. So I started looking for a simple and flexible Docker Compose workflow that'll allow me more control over the environment and, and I stumbled on [Andrew Schmelyun's](https://github.com/aschmelyun) repo.

While the original project is fantastic, it doesnâ€™t support arm64-based chips (Apple M1, M2, M3) and hasn't been updated in a while.

For those interested, [Andrew](https://github.com/aschmelyun) has provided a [comprehensive walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIqWxjDj4IU) detailing the setup process.

### Improvements from the original fork
- Arm64 Support: Now compatible with Apple M1, M2, and M3 chips.
- Updated Tooling: Utilizes PHP 8.2 and MySQL 8.
- Environment Variables: Enhanced configurability.
- Improved Docker Naming: Better container and network naming conventions.
- Persistent Storage: Enabled by default for data persistence.

## Usage

To get started, make sure you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) on your system, and then clone this repository.

Next, navigate in your terminal to the directory you cloned this, and spin up the containers for the web server by running `docker-compose up -d --build site`.

After that completes, follow the steps from the [wordpress/README.md](src/README.md) file to get your WordPress installation added in (or create a new blank one).

Bringing up the Docker Compose network with `site` instead of just using `up`, ensures that only our site's containers are brought up at the start, instead of all of the command containers as well. The following are built for our web server, with their exposed ports detailed:

- **nginx** - `:80`
- **mysql** - `:3306`
- **php** - `:9000`

An additional container is included that lets you use the wp-cli app without having to install it on your local machine. Use the following command examples from your project root, modifying them to fit your particular use case.

- `docker-compose run --rm wp user list`

## Persistent MySQL Storage

By default, the data in the database will be persistent even after you bring down the Docker network.

If you want to reset the database after running `docker compose down`, remove the `volumes` argument from the mysql service in `docker-compose.yml`.

Remove:
```
volumes:
  - ./mysql:/var/lib/mysql
```
